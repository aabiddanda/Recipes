Heat skillet with a little olive oil on it and lay a tortilla down on the skillet. Sprinkle cheese over the tortilla, and then layer the quesadilla filling over the cheese. Sprinkle cheese again, and seal with additional tortilla. Flip carefully so that cheese on both sides of filling is melted and seals in filling. Serve alongside yogurt and salsa.
